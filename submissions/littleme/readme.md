#  Why I Created It
I created this cli project to make learning fun and interactive by learning from your own mistakes and getting roasted by a virtual clone of yourself who still motivates you to do better
rather then just some todo app or a note taking app why not have a virtual clone of yourself who will even roast you every time, lol
